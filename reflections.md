Search Inside Yourself reflections:

Chapter 1 of this book was very interesting; I appreciate how it seems to be grounded in science, and it aligns surprisingly well with another book I am reading for a different purpose. It’s interesting to think about creating the conditions for happiness as a trainable skill (active), rather than an emotion that happens in response to something positive (passive). It’s impressive that regular mindfulness for a few months can result in actual changes to the brain - it seems almost too easy to be true.

Critical Inner Voice reflections:

Great video, and very relevant. I feel this inner critic is related to imposter syndrome, which affects me, and is likely to affect me strongly as I work towards becoming a developer. One way that I address my inner critic is by stepping back, assessing whether what my critic is saying is based in reality or just plain damaging. What evidence is there, if any, that this is true? Changing the ‘tone’ of self-talk and having compassion for oneself goes a long way. 

Privilege Video reflections

I have had a very privileged upbringing, with years and years of diverse, high quality education, and many many opportunities. However, some of this education was in public health, which focuses on socioeconomic factors contributing to inequality.
Inequality is something that is very easily out of sight, out of mind, so it’s important to be reminded of and consider how one’s actions can reduce it.
